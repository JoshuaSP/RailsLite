# Rails Lite!

This is a very light-weight homage to Rails, which supports routes, views, params, controller actions, session tokens, authenticity tokens, flash, and route helpers.

The `test_server` in `bin`, contains the equivalent of the consumer-written rails controllers.  RailsLite, in the lib directory, contains the base classes corresponding to ActionController::Base, etc.

The views rendered by the controllers are found in the views directories in the same format as they would be in Rails.
